<h2 class="verse" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Langar', cursive; font-size: 25px; top: -40px; position: relative;">Psalm 19:12-14, 139:23-24</h2>  
<p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; font-weight: 600;">Brian and his dad were enjoying a football game on TV. "Watch out for that guy on your right!" yelled Brian and Dad waved his arms as if the players could see him. But it was no use the man they were cheering for was down. "That was dumb!" exclaimed Brian in disgust. "He should have seen the guy coming at him! He wasn't paying attention."Dad nodded. "The coach pulled him out now, and I expected they'll show him an instant play of that move. I'm sure he won't make the same mistake again." 
<br>
<br>
Once the game was over, they headed to the table for supper. "Hey! How come Gretchen gets a hot turkey sandwish and the rest of us get yucky old tuna casserole?"" asked Brian, glancing at his sister's plate. He yanked out his chair and bumped the table hard as he sat down. "You're just a spoiled brat," he siad to Gretchen. Gretchen began to speak, but Brian won't listen not even when his mother tried yo explain. He interrupted her and continued to grumble as he roughly gave his plate a shove, spilling his milk.
<br>
<br> 	
"Brian, go to your room!" ordered Dad. "your behaviour is not fit for this table and it doesn't please God. You can come back when you're ready to apologize." Brian knew it was no use to protest, so he went to his room, hungry and angry. He plopped down his head on his bed. In his mind, he replayed what had happened. He tried to tell himself that he'd been treated unfairly and that Gretchen was spoiled. But then he remmembered that Gretchen had been sick when they'd had turkey the day before and his mother had saved some for her. That's why she is getting it now, he thought. he'd made mess of the situation and hurt her sister's feelings.
<br>
<br>
The rest of the family was almost finished when Brian returned and took his place at the table. He looked at his dad. "In my mind, I watched an instant replay of what happened" said Brian. "I guess if I did that more often, I wouldn't keep on making so many mistakes." He turned to his mom and his sister and said. "I'm realy sorry for the way I acted." By Phyllis M. Robinson</p>

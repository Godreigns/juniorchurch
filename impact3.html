<h2 class="verse" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Langar', cursive; font-size: 25px; top: -40px; position: relative;">Romans 8:1-4</h2>  
<p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; font-weight: 600;">Tristan sighed as the bell signalling the end of recess rang. "Come on," he said to his freind Aria. "We'd better hurry or we'll get into trouble."
<br>
<br>
"Yeah," Aria said. "Mrs. McGinn is so strict. Her rules are impossible!"
<br>
As Tristan worked on his math that afternoon, his pencil point broke. He tapped Aria on the shoulder.
<br>
"Do you have an extra pencil?" he whispered.
<br>
"Tristan," said Mrs. McGinn sternly. "You know the rule about not whispering in class. You broke that rule, so you will stay inside during morning recess tomorrow." Tristan tried to explain but it was no use.
<br>
<br> 	
When Tristan told his parent about it, Mom shook her hand."I'm sorry," she said, "But you knew the rule, so you really can't complain. Next time ask Mrs. McGinn for a pencil insted of Aria.".
<br>
Dad picked up his Bible. "Ready for family devotion? I belive we are up to Exodus 20, and it's your turn to read, Tristan."
<br>
Tristan took the Bible and bean to read. "More rules!" he exclaimed after reading several verses.
<br>
<br>
Dad nodded. "These rules are called the Ten Commandments. They were given to the Israelites as part of God's law," he said. "The Bible also tells us what the punishmeant will be given to the Israelites deobeyed them."
<br>
"Is it bad as Mr. McGinn?" asked Tristan.
<br>
<br>
"Much worse. Sin is a terrible offense against God, and sometimes the punishment was death," said Mom. "In fact, the final penalty for sin is eternal death for all people. That's punishment in hell forever."
<br>
<br>
"But we can experince God's grace instead of the punishment we deserve," said Dad. "We've all done things that are wrong and are therefore guilty of breaking God's law.  But Jesus paid the penalty for our sin. All we need to do is trust in Him for forgiveness."
<br>
<br>
Mom nodded. "God still expects Christians to obey him, but we don't need to fear eternal punishment. Jesus took that for us."
<br>
<br>
"It would be nice if someone would take my punishment from Mrs. McGinn, too," said Tristan with a wry grin, "but at least it won't last forever!"</p>

<h2 class="verse" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Langar', cursive; font-size: 25px; top: -40px; position: relative;">1 Timothy 2:1-8</h2>  
<p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; font-weight: 600;">Justin frowned as he poured some cereal and lookes out the window. "Joanna never quits talking," he thought as he saw his sister coming up the driveway. I wish she'd leave me alone. He snapped his fingers. I know what will fix her. I''ll give her the silent treatment. So when Joanna came into the house , Justin retreated to his room. She banged on is door and called his name, but he put on some music and turned up the volume so he couldn't hear her, and Joanna finally gave up and walked away.
<br>
<br>
A little while later, Joanna started to tell Justin something, but he covered his ears with both his hands and began to hum. "I'll teach her a lesson", he thought. All morning he refused to hear anything she said.
<br>
<br> 	
At lunchtime, Justin noticed that Joanna had put on her swimsuit. "Are you going somewhere, Joanna?" asked Dad.
<br>
<br>
"I'm going to Water World with the Mannings," explained Joanna 
<br>
<br>
"Sounds like fun," said Dad. He looked at Justin. "You're not going?"
<br>
<br>
"I wasn't invited," Justin answered crossly.
<br>
<br>
"You were, too! I tried to tell you all morning, but you wouldn't listen."
<br>
<br>
"Oh, no!" wailed Justin as the Mannings' car turned into the driveway. He didn't have enough time to finish his chores.
<br>
<br>
That evening, Justin askd his parents for help with an assignment for Bible club . "Our leader wants us each to write a short essay on prayer," he said.
<br>
<br>
"Well, let's see," said Dad. "Maybe you could talk about the importance of talking to God and listening to Him."
<br>
<br>
"You could tel about how you missed out on a fun outing today by refusing to talk with your sister," suggested Mom. "Then explain that we all lose out on blessings when we fail to communicate with the Lord. We sometimes give him the silent treatment."
<br>
<br>
Dad nodded. "When we do that, it certainly hurts us. We need to keep open communication with Him and not try to work thins out on all on our own. He wants us to talk with Him about everything."
<br>
<br>
"Good idea," said Justin. "I'll call my essay the 'The Silent Treatment'" By Nance E. Keyes</p>

<p class="about" style="font-family: 'Langar', cursive; font-size: 25px; position: relative; top: -30px; text-align: center;">Do you regularly talk to God? Do you tell Him what's going on in your life and ask Him for help with your problems? Or do you think it doesn't make any difference whether you pray or not? It does! Don't give God the silent treatment and try to work things out in your own way. He wants to help you. Talk to Him about everything.</p>
